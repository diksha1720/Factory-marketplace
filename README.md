Unleash your event with NFTs and currency on Polygon!
Hey creators, listen up!  Tired of limiting event experiences? I've built a powerful tool to unlock boundless possibilities on the Polygon Network.

Whitelisted Access & Tokenized Participation:

I crafted a factory contract that churns out two key components:

Unique NFT Tickets: These beauties tie directly to your real-world events, granting access and igniting excitement.
Fungible Currency Tokens: Your dedicated event currency, minted by whitelisted participants using their pre-set allowances.
Whitelist Management at Your Fingertips:

You control the guest list! Effortlessly manage 1 million whitelisted addresses with per-address allowances.
Add new participants or adjust allowances anytime, ensuring flexibility and inclusivity.
Dynamic Pricing & Limited Editions:

Set the perfect ticket price and adjust it as needed to match your event's value.
Control the total number of NFTs mintable, creating excitement through limited editions.
Seamless Marketplaces:

Let the fun begin! Your primary marketplace allows whitelisted users to purchase NFTs using their event currency.
A thriving secondary marketplace lets users resell their NFTs, but with a twist: prices can't exceed the previous sale, fostering a healthy ecosystem.
Organizer, You Win Too!

Earn a slice of the pie! I've integrated a monetization option for you in secondary market sales, rewarding your efforts.

P.S. This is just a summary. The actual code goes much deeper, ensuring security, efficiency, and customization for your specific needs.
